## Array Assertions

`isArray()` test if the value passed in is an array and returns a boolean
`isNotArray` tests if the value passed in is anything BUT an array and returns a boolean
`include()` tests if a value is present within another object or list
`notInclude` tests if a value is not present within another object or list
```js

```

UPDATE:
After testing the branching strategy for study purposes, I have concluded that it may be more efficient to chunk the information a bit more in the context of this specific course. This branch is for lessons 11 and 12 (Test if a value is an array and contains and item)
